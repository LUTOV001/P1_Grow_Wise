## **Technologies and Tools**

### The following list includes the main technologies and tools using during the preparation and deployment of the solution:
### 1. *Python* - Programming language used to code the solution. Version 3.7.13 was used
### 2. *GitHub* - Reposotory for code deployment, version management and documentation of the presented solution
### 3. *Jupyter Labs* - IDE tool for coding, code testing/debugging and solution documentation. Version V3.4.4 was used
### 4. *Git Bash console* - Local console used to test the coded solution and sync with GitHub. Version 2.40.1.windows.1 was utilized for this challenge
### 5. *Slack* - Collaboration tool to communicate and brainstorm with other FinTech Bootcamp participants
### 6. *Operative System* - This solution was prepared in a PC running Windows 11 v H22
### 7. *[OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap)* - OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) dataset and project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing a lot of information about our environment. It contains data for example about streets, buildings, different services, and landuse to mention a few. While no additional installation was required for the current challenge, we are using OSM to source the rendering of the San Francisco neighborhoods for the interactive map part of the challenge.
### 8. *[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)* - Bokeh is a Python library used to make interactive graphs and visualizations using HTML and JavaScript.
### 9. *[GeoViews](https://geoviews.org/)* -  GeoViews is a Python library that provides a high-level interface for working with geographical data and creating interactive visualizations.

## **Solution Structure**

### The **[P1_Grow_Wise](https://github.com/LUTOV001/P1_Grow_Wise)** repository in GitHub contains the solution components. The repository consists of the following folders, subfolders and contents as described below:
 
###    1. Images : Includes the .png image files to illustrate the instructions in the Solution Jupyter Notebook. 
###    2. Resources : Includes the files with Real Estate data used for the analysis:
####     | 2.1 housing_per_year.csv
####     | 2.2 neighborhood_coordinates.csv
####     | 2.3 sfo_neigborhoods_census_data.csv
###    3. gitignore : Instructions for which files/file types to exclude from GitHub sync
###    4. README.md - The present file containing the outline of the repository and the solution
###    5. *add the main notebook here.ipnyb* is the Jupyter Notebook with the code for the core GroWise solution
---
## **User Instructions**

### 1. Launch the Jupyter Lab from the GitBash terminal using the following command line:
```python 
jupyter lab
```
